##### Obsidian Overhead
#Research #ION
##### <u>Meeting Discussion</u>

- Discussed necessary changes to build ION on windows with automake
	- Edit the path variable to include wherever various libraries are stored
	- Add winsock compilation option
	- Format specifiers to Unix standard
	- Comment out some bpsecadmin code (EX. gsvc_map)
	- Remove include for jsmn.h
- Currently dealing with odd output, limbo test output, along with the log file for ./configure was sent.
	- As of right now, winion.c and killm are not being found, which is what could be causing the error.
	- Begin looking around line 354 of makefile.am (which should be the currently used makefile)
	- The inclusion of killm.c and winion.c need to be implemented, and the transfer might be funky. look at ionadmin, see how it's converted, and use that same strategy. 
	- In the scripts section of makefile.am (towards the beginning), make sure killm isn't being looked for in usr/local/bin


***********************************************************************
##### <u>Current Goals</u>

- [x] Understand what changes between the implementation of ionadmin within the developmental makefiles to the automake files (pretty sure here, if not ask Patricia)
- [x] Implement case within the makefile for killm.c
- [ ] Implement case within the makefile for winion.c
- [ ] Review the script section of makefile.am relating to killm, and make sure that it is being included from the correct place

##### To Do
- [x] Ask Patricia to refresh about what is happening in general
- [ ] Copy over changes from something like rfxclock to build winion and killm the same way as what's happening in makefile.am
